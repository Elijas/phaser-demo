Simple Phaser game library demo with HTML5
## Description

- The center circle either seeks or runs away from the debris pieces floating around.
- The only pieces the circle sees is in the vision range marked as the outer circle.
- Clicking green (when debris is nearby) will make circle seek for the pieces.
- Clicking red instead will make circle run away from the debris at all costs.
